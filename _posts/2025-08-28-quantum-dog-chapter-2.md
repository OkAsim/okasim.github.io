## Cornell Notes

**What is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle?**
- You CANNOT know both the exact position AND exact velocity of something at the same time
- If you measure position more precisely, velocity becomes more uncertain
- If you measure velocity more precisely, position becomes more uncertain

**What is the semiclassical explanation?**
- When you try to measure where a particle is, you disturb how fast it's moving
- Like trying to find a rabbit when you get close, it runs away!
- To see an electron, you must bounce light off it, which changes its motion

**What is the deeper explanation?**
- Uncertainty isn't just about measurement limitations
- Position and velocity don't have exact values at the same time
- It's not that we "don't know" they actually CAN'T have exact values together

**What are wavefunctions?**
- Mathematical functions that describe quantum objects
- Give probability of finding an object at different positions
- Like a map showing where a particle might be found

**What are wave packets?**
- Special wavefunctions that describe particles with wave nature
- Combination of many waves with different wavelengths
- Have both particle-like and wave-like properties

**How do wave packets relate to uncertainty?**
- To make a wave packet with precise position, need many waves with different wavelengths
- This gives more uncertainty in wavelength (momentum/velocity)
- Can't have both precise position and precise wavelength at same time

**What is zero-point energy?**
- Energy that quantum objects have even at their lowest possible energy
- Due to uncertainty principle they can never be completely still
- Like puppies in a basket always squirming even when asleep

**How does this affect atoms?**
- Electrons don't orbit like planets around the nucleus
- They form "clouds" of probability around the nucleus
- Can never be completely at rest or in a fixed orbit

**What does uncertainty mean for everyday life?**
- For large objects like dogs, the uncertainty is extremely tiny
- A dog's position could be uncertain by 10⁻³¹ meters (smaller than an atom)
- That's why we don't notice quantum uncertainty in everyday life

## Summary

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that we can never know both exactly where something is AND exactly how fast it's moving at the same time. This isn't just because measuring disturbs things - position and velocity actually CAN'T have exact values together! This happens because everything has a wave nature. To describe something with a precise position, you need many waves with different wavelengths, which increases uncertainty in velocity. This principle causes electrons to form "clouds" around atoms rather than fixed orbits, and gives all particles a minimum energy called zero-point energy. For large objects like dogs and people, the uncertainty exists but is far too small to notice.
