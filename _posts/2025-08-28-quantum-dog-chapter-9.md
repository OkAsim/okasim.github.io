## Cornell Notes

**What is energy-time uncertainty?**
- A version of the uncertainty principle
- If you measure energy very precisely, time becomes uncertain
- If you measure time very precisely, energy becomes uncertain
- ΔE × Δt ≥ h/4π (uncertainty in energy × uncertainty in time ≥ minimum value)

**How does energy-time uncertainty work?**
- Like counting oscillations to measure frequency
- Short measurement time = less precise frequency measurement
- Long measurement time = more precise frequency measurement
- Cannot have both precise time and precise frequency

**What are virtual particles?**
- Particles that appear and disappear too quickly to be directly detected
- Allowed by energy-time uncertainty
- Can "borrow" energy from empty space for very short times
- Always appear in pairs (particle and antiparticle)

**How long do virtual particles exist?**
- Depends on their mass (more mass = shorter time)
- Electron-positron pair: about 10⁻²¹ seconds
- Proton-antiproton pair: about 10⁻²⁴ seconds
- Larger objects (like rabbits): around 10⁻⁵² seconds (incredibly brief!)

**What is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)?**
- Theory describing interactions between light and charged particles
- Considers all interactions as exchanges of photons
- Developed by Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and others
- One of the most precisely tested theories in physics

**What are Feynman diagrams?**
- Pictures showing particle interactions
- Each diagram tells a story about what particles do
- Straight lines = electrons or other particles
- Wavy lines = photons
- Time flows from bottom to top

**How do virtual particles affect real particles?**
- Change how real particles interact
- Real electrons constantly emit and absorb virtual photons
- Virtual photons can turn into virtual electron-positron pairs
- All these possibilities happen at once in quantum superposition

**What is the g-factor?**
- Number that tells how electrons interact with magnetic fields
- Simple theory predicts g = 2 exactly
- Virtual particles change this value slightly
- Scientists have measured g-factor to 14 decimal places!

**How do we know virtual particles exist?**
- They affect measurements of the electron g-factor
- QED calculations including virtual particles match experiments perfectly
- Agreement between theory and experiment to 14 decimal places!
- Best tested theory in the history of science

**What are practical applications?**
- Differences between prediction and measurement can reveal new particles
- Helps scientists study particles too heavy to create in accelerators
- Powers the Sun! Nuclear fusion happens because of quantum tunneling

## Summary

Virtual particles are temporary particles that pop in and out of existence too quickly to detect directly, allowed by the energy-time uncertainty principle. They always appear in particle-antiparticle pairs and exist for incredibly brief moments. Though we can't see them directly, virtual particles have real effects on measurable quantities like the electron's g-factor. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), which includes virtual particles, predicts experimental results with amazing accuracy to 14 decimal places! This makes QED the most precisely tested theory in science history. While we'll never see "bunnies made of cheese" appearing from empty space, the quantum world is constantly bubbling with these fleeting virtual particles.
