## Cornell Notes

**How does physics relate to other sciences?**
- Physics is the most fundamental science
- Other sciences can be understood through physics principles
- Chemistry, biology, astronomy all depend on physical laws
- However, complex systems require specialized approaches
- Knowing physics doesn't mean we can solve everything in other fields

**How does physics connect to chemistry?**
- Chemistry is fundamentally physics at work
- All chemical reactions follow quantum mechanics
- Atoms combining is explained by electrical forces
- Statistical mechanics explains behavior of large numbers of molecules
- Periodic table patterns explained by atomic structure
- Theoretical chemistry = quantum physics applied to molecules

**What is statistical mechanics?**
- Method for dealing with huge numbers of particles
- Can't track every molecule individually
- Uses probability and averages instead
- Explains heat, pressure, temperature
- Connects microscopic behavior to macroscopic properties
- Essential for understanding gases, liquids, and thermodynamics

**How does physics relate to biology?**
- All biological processes follow physical laws
- Key principle: "Everything that animals do, atoms do"
- Living things are very complex arrangements of atoms
- Examples of physics in biology:
  - Nerves: electrical signals in cells
  - Muscles: chemical energy → motion
  - Vision, hearing: detecting light/sound waves
  - DNA: molecular structure carries information

**How do cells work?**
- All living things made of cells
- Cells contain complex chemical machinery
- Enzymes: large protein molecules that speed up reactions
- Enzymes work by holding molecules in right positions
- Chemical reactions require "activation energy" to start
- Enzymes lower this energy barrier

**What is DNA and why is it important?**
- DNA = deoxyribonucleic acid
- Double helix structure (two chains twisted together)
- Contains instructions for making proteins
- Can reproduce itself (each chain makes a copy)
- Base pairs: A-T and C-G (complementary)
- Sequence of bases codes for different proteins
- This is how genetic information is stored and passed on

**How does physics relate to astronomy?**
- Same physical laws apply throughout universe
- Stars made of same atoms as Earth
- Can identify elements in stars using light spectra
- Nuclear reactions in stars explained by physics
- Gravity explains planetary motion and galaxy structure
- Can predict stellar evolution using physics

**How does physics relate to geology?**
- Physical principles govern Earth processes
- Gravity, heat flow, pressure explain many phenomena
- Examples: erosion, mountain formation, volcanism
- But some problems too complex to solve:
  - Turbulent fluid flow (still unsolved!)
  - Earthquake prediction difficult
  - Weather forecasting limited by complexity

**What about psychology?**
- Brain function involves physics and chemistry
- Nerve signals are electrical/chemical processes
- Memory storage mechanism still unknown
- How thinking works is not fully understood
- Some aspects similar to computing machines
- Much more complex than current understanding

**What are the limitations of physics?**
- Knowing basic laws ≠ solving all problems
- Complexity makes many calculations impossible
- Need different approaches for different scales
- Each science has its own useful methods
- Historical questions require different thinking
- Some problems (like turbulence) remain unsolved

## Summary

Chapter 3 explores how physics relates to other sciences, showing that physics provides the fundamental laws underlying chemistry, biology, astronomy, and geology. While all natural phenomena ultimately follow physical principles (atoms obeying physical laws), the enormous complexity of real-world systems means we cannot simply "reduce" everything to physics calculations. Each science has developed specialized approaches appropriate to its domain. Feynman uses examples like DNA structure, enzyme function, and stellar composition to show both the power and limitations of physical understanding. The chapter emphasizes that while physics is foundational, understanding complex systems like living organisms, weather, or human consciousness requires multiple levels of description and remains an ongoing challenge.
