**Chapter:** 1 - Which Way? Both Ways

## Cornell Notes

**What is quantum physics?**
- A part of "modern physics" developed after 1900
- Deals with very small things like atoms and light
- Has strange rules different from everyday physics

**What are particles?**
- Objects like tennis balls, bones, or squeaky toys
- Have a definite position
- Have a definite velocity
- Can be counted

**What are waves?**
- Moving patterns like water splashing in a pond
- Spread out over space rather than being in one spot
- Have properties like wavelength and frequency
- Can add together or cancel each other out

**What is particle-wave duality?**
- Everything in the universe is BOTH a particle AND a wave
- Light acts like particles (photons)
- Electrons act like waves

## Summary

Quantum physics tells us that everything in the universe has BOTH particle and wave properties at the same time. Particles are in one place and can be counted. Waves spread out and can cancel each other. Light acts like particles called photons. Electrons act like waves and can diffract. Even people and dogs have wavelengths, but they're so incredibly small we never notice wave behaviors in everyday life.
