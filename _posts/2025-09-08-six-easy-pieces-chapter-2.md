## Cornell Notes

**What is the purpose of physics?**
- To find basic rules that explain natural phenomena
- To simplify complex observations into fundamental principles
- To discover patterns that connect seemingly different events
- To explain many effects using fewer causes
- To predict how things will behave

**How does Feynman describe the scientific process?**
- Like figuring out rules of a chess game by watching it play
- We don't know all the rules yet
- Even knowing rules doesn't mean we can predict complex situations
- Three ways to test theories:
  1. Testing in simple situations
  2. Checking consequences like "bishops always on same color"
  3. Using rough approximation when exact calculation is too hard

**What major divisions of physics exist?**
- **Pre-1920 "Classical Physics":**
  - Mechanics (motion, forces)
  - Thermodynamics (heat)
  - Electromagnetism (electricity, magnetism, light)
- **Post-1920 "Modern Physics":**
  - Relativity (very fast objects, gravity)
  - Quantum Mechanics (very small objects)

**What makes up the physical "stage"?**
- Before 1920: Three-dimensional space + time as separate things
- Einstein changed this to "space-time"
- Objects on this stage are particles moving according to forces
- Forces include gravitation and interaction forces
- Light discovered to be electromagnetic waves

**How does electricity work?**
- Objects contain positive and negative charges
- Like charges repel, opposite charges attract
- Most objects have balanced charges unless disturbed
- Electric fields form around charges
- Moving charges create magnetism
- Electricity and magnetism are two aspects of same thing

**What is the electromagnetic spectrum?**
- All electromagnetic waves differ only in frequency
- From lowest to highest frequency:
  - Radio waves
  - Microwaves
  - Infrared
  - Visible light
  - Ultraviolet
  - X-rays
  - Gamma rays
- All travel at the speed of light

**What is quantum mechanics?**
- Theory describing the behavior of very small things
- Replaced classical physics for atomic-scale phenomena
- Key features:
  1. Wave-particle duality (things behave as both)
  2. Uncertainty principle (can't know position and momentum exactly)
  3. Probabilistic rather than deterministic
  4. Measurement affects the system
- Explains atoms, chemical bonding, light emission

**What particles make up atoms?**
- **Electrons:** Negative charge, move around nucleus
- **Protons:** Positive charge, in nucleus
- **Neutrons:** No charge, in nucleus
- Plus many other subatomic particles discovered later

**What forces exist in nature?**
- Gravitational force (very weak but long-range)
- Electromagnetic force (stronger, between charged particles)
- Weak nuclear force (responsible for some radioactivity)
- Strong nuclear force (holds atomic nuclei together)
- Each has different strength and properties

## Summary

Chapter 2 provides an overview of basic physics, describing it as the search for fundamental rules that govern natural phenomena. Feynman compares understanding physics to figuring out the rules of a chess game by watching it play. He divides physics into classical (pre-1920) and modern physics, with quantum mechanics representing a revolutionary break from classical ideas. The chapter explains how our understanding evolved from separate theories about motion, heat, and electricity to a more unified framework, while acknowledging many mysteries remain unsolved, especially in the realm of subatomic particles and their interactions.
