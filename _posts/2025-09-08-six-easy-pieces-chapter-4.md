## Cornell Notes

**What is the law of conservation of energy?**
- There is a quantity called "energy" that does not change
- Energy can move around and change forms
- But the total amount always stays the same
- No known exceptions to this law
- One of the most fundamental principles in all of physics

**Why is energy conservation "abstract"?**
- Energy is a mathematical principle, not a visible thing
- It's not a description of a mechanism
- We calculate a number that stays constant
- We don't fully understand "what" energy is
- Energy doesn't come in visible "blobs" or chunks
- It's like counting something invisible that never changes total

**What is the Dennis the Menace analogy?**
- Dennis has 28 indestructible toy blocks
- Mom counts them at start and end of each day
- Sometimes blocks are hidden:
  - Under the rug
  - In the toy box
  - Outside the window
- Mom must look everywhere to find all 28
- Total is always 28, never 27 or 29
- Energy works exactly like this - changes location/form but total stays constant

**How does Feynman derive gravitational potential energy?**
- Uses thought experiment with weight-lifting machines
- Assumes perpetual motion is impossible
- Reversible machines are most efficient
- If machine lowers 1 lb by 1 ft and lifts 3 lbs, it lifts by exactly 1/3 ft
- General formula: PE = (weight) × (height)
- This can be figured out by logic alone!

**What are practical applications of energy conservation?**
- Calculating mechanical advantage in simple machines
- Understanding inclined planes (3-4-5 triangle example)
- Analyzing screw jacks and levers
- Balancing weighted rods
- Principle of virtual work in engineering
- Energy conservation simplifies complex mechanical problems

**What is kinetic energy?**
- Energy an object has because of its motion
- Formula: KE = ½mv² (mass × velocity squared ÷ 2)
- Allows moving objects to do work as they slow down
- Example: pendulum converts between potential and kinetic energy
  - At top of swing: all potential energy
  - At bottom of swing: all kinetic energy
  - Energy continuously transforms between the two forms

**What is elastic energy?**
- Energy stored in stretched or compressed springs
- When spring is stretched, it can do work
- Energy goes back and forth between:
  - Elastic energy (spring stretched/compressed)
  - Kinetic energy (spring moving)
- Without friction, this would continue forever

**What is heat energy?**
- Actually just kinetic energy of random atomic motion
- When things rub together, atoms jiggle randomly
- This internal motion is what we call "heat"
- Can measure it with thermometers
- Energy hasn't disappeared - it's just become disorganized
- This is why machines eventually stop moving

**What other forms of energy exist?**
- **Electrical energy:** from electric charges and fields
- **Radiant energy:** light and electromagnetic waves
- **Chemical energy:** stored in molecular bonds (partly kinetic, partly electrical)
- **Nuclear energy:** in atomic nuclei (different from other forces)
- **Mass energy:** E = mc² (Einstein's equation)
  - Objects have energy just from existing
  - Matter can convert to pure energy

**What is the connection between energy and symmetry?**
- Conservation of energy relates to time symmetry
- Things don't depend on absolute time
- Conservation of momentum relates to space symmetry
- Things don't depend on absolute position
- Conservation of angular momentum relates to rotational symmetry
- These deep connections discovered through quantum mechanics

**What are other conservation laws?**
- Conservation of charge: total electric charge never changes
- Conservation of baryons: certain particles conserved in reactions
- Conservation of leptons: certain particles conserved in reactions
- Three "simple" conservation laws (counting things)
- Three "subtle" conservation laws (involving space and time)

**What's the difference between energy conservation and energy availability?**
- Energy is always conserved (total never changes)
- But available energy can decrease
- Heat energy is less "useful" than organized motion
- This involves concept of entropy
- Thermodynamics governs available energy
- Nature conserves energy but "wastes" useful forms

**Where do we get our energy supplies?**
- Most energy ultimately comes from the Sun
- Rain: from solar evaporation
- Coal: from ancient plants that used sunlight
- Also: uranium (nuclear fission)
- Potential: hydrogen fusion (like the Sun)
- Example: 10 quarts of water/second could power entire USA (if fusion controlled)

## Summary

Chapter 4 introduces the law of conservation of energy - one of the most fundamental principles in physics stating that energy can change forms but the total amount never changes. Feynman uses the Dennis the Menace block analogy to illustrate this abstract concept and derives gravitational potential energy through logical reasoning about impossible perpetual motion machines. Energy exists in many forms (kinetic, potential, thermal, electrical, chemical, nuclear, and mass energy), all of which can transform into one another while maintaining constant total. The chapter also introduces other conservation laws and explores the connection between conservation laws and fundamental symmetries in nature. While energy is always conserved, the availability of useful energy is governed by thermodynamics and entropy.
