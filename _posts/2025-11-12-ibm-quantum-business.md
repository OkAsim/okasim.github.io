## Cornell Notes

**Why should companies care about quantum computers?**
- Regular supercomputers are AMAZING but they struggle when there are tons of variables (changing things) that interact in complicated ways
- This is like trying to solve a puzzle with 1 million pieces all connected together
- Quantum computers can handle this type of problem
- This helps with: designing new medicines, creating new materials, solving big business challenges, and discovering new solutions
- Companies that start experimenting NOW will have a huge advantage later!

**What are the three main problem types quantum helps with?**
Three Big Problem Types:
1. **Simulating Nature:** Predicting how molecules and chemicals will behave without having to test them in a lab over and over. Saves time and money!
2. **Artificial Intelligence:** Training computers to learn from data way faster than classical computers
3. **Optimization:** Finding the BEST solution to complicated problems with tons of options. Like finding the fastest delivery route or the best price

**Why is molecule simulation expensive and slow?**
The Problem: To understand how a molecule behaves, scientists have to:
1. Make it in a lab
2. Test it
3. If they want to try a tiny change, they have to make a NEW version
4. Test the new version
5. Repeat, repeat, repeat

This takes MONTHS or YEARS and costs MILLIONS of dollars. Quantum computers could simulate all these versions instantly!

## Industries That Will Be TRANSFORMED by Quantum

### Distribution and Logistics
**What Problem Are They Solving?** Airlines, shipping companies, and delivery services have HUGE optimization problems.

**Real Examples:**
- NC State and Delta Air Lines worked together to use quantum for airline gate-scheduling (deciding which plane uses which gate)
- Walmart runs one of the world's biggest supercomputers just to figure out shipping and logistics
- Online shopping = BILLIONS of packages to deliver optimally

**Quantum Could Help With:**
- Route optimization (finding fastest delivery paths)
- Scheduling (when planes leave, which gates, which pilots)
- Cargo loading (how to pack trucks most efficiently)
- Managing disruptions (when planes are late, how does that affect everything?)
- Supply chain problems (too much inventory or too little?)
- Customer service (showing you what products you want to see)

**Why This Matters:** The complexity EXPLODES as the problem gets bigger. A 10% improvement in delivery efficiency = MILLIONS of dollars saved.

### Financial Services
**What Problem Are They Solving?** Banks and investment firms need to manage RISK and predict market outcomes.

**Real Examples:**
- JPMorgan Chase: Uses quantum to predict financial option prices
- Goldman Sachs: Exploring quantum for market predictions
- PayPal: Working with IBM on fraud detection
- HSBC: Exploring quantum for pricing and portfolio optimization

**Quantum Could Help With:**
- Monte Carlo simulations (predicting different market scenarios)
- Risk management (what could go wrong with our investments?)
- Fraud detection (spotting fake transactions)
- Credit scoring (deciding if someone should get a loan)
- Pricing models (what price should we charge?)
- Anti-money laundering (finding suspicious transactions)

**The Quantum Advantage:** Quantum computers can calculate outcomes FASTER and MORE ACCURATELY. This means: either get answers in less time, OR get more confident answers in the same time. For Wall Street traders, even 1% more accuracy = HUGE money!

### Healthcare and Life Sciences
**What Problem Are They Solving?** Finding new medicines and understanding how diseases work. This requires simulating complex molecular structures.

**Real Examples:**
- Cleveland Clinic: 10-year partnership with IBM to use AI and quantum for healthcare discovery
- Amgen: Using quantum machine learning to analyze patient health records
- IBM researchers: Created quantum algorithm for protein folding problem

**Quantum Could Help With:**
- **Diagnostics:** Figuring out what disease a person has
- **Personalized Medicine:** Creating treatments specifically for YOU and your DNA
- **Drug Discovery:** Testing millions of potential medicines MUCH faster
- **Protein Folding:** Understanding 3D structure of proteins (really important for medicine!)
- **Insurance Pricing:** Predicting health risks for pricing
- **Life Sciences:** Understanding how genes work, predicting protein behavior, discovering new drug compounds

**Why This Matters:** A new drug usually takes 10-15 YEARS to develop and costs BILLIONS. Quantum could cut that time dramatically. Plus: better medicines, faster discovery, saving lives!

### Industrial Discrete Manufacturing
**What Problem Are They Solving?** Making physical products better, faster, and cheaper (cars, airplanes, electronics).

**Real Examples:**
- **Aerospace and Defense:** Optimizing flight routes, computational fluid dynamics (how air moves around planes), material development (stronger, lighter materials)
- **Automotive (Car Companies):** Daimler Mercedes-Benz used quantum for battery chemistry research, battery design and development, software testing and validation, factory automation, quality control
- **Electronics:** JSR working with IBM on semiconductor chip development, fab scheduling (organizing factory production), chip performance optimization, product design

**Quantum Could Help With:**
- Simulating molecular properties of new battery materials
- Testing new product designs virtually instead of in real labs
- Optimizing factory production schedules
- Quality control (finding defects faster)
- Advanced materials with better performance

**The Daimler Story:** Daimler wanted to develop better car batteries. Simulating all the molecular properties is IMPOSSIBLE for classical supercomputers. They worked with IBM to use quantum computing. Why? Because delaying battery technology by even 1-2 years = BILLIONS in lost market opportunities!

### Industrial Process Manufacturing (Chemicals and Petroleum)
**What Problem Are They Solving?** Creating new materials and energy solutions through complex chemistry simulations.

**Real Examples:**
- ExxonMobil: Demonstrated quantum computing for thermodynamic calculations (how energy moves in chemistry)
- Mitsubishi Chemical: Researching OLED materials (used in phone screens!), researching better battery technology, discovering cleaner fuels

**Quantum Could Help With:**
- Accurately predicting chemical reactions without physical testing
- Developing new energy solutions
- Creating advanced materials
- Battery research
- Understanding molecular structures
- Making cleaner, more efficient fuels

**ExxonMobil Quote:** Dr. Vijay Swarup said: "We know in our bones that there are huge global challenges we will tackle. When quantum becomes utterly disruptive, we'll be ready." Translation: They're preparing NOW for when quantum gets really powerful!

### Utilities, Energy, and Telecommunications
**What Problem Are They Solving?** Managing energy grids and helping the world go green (net-zero targets).

**Real Examples:**
- **Energy Companies:** E.ON using quantum to optimize decentralized energy (solar panels, electric cars, local power sharing), bp exploring quantum to achieve net-zero goals, Woodside Energy testing quantum algorithms for energy systems
- **Telecommunications:** Vodafone exploring quantum for network routing and workload balancing

**The Big Idea:** Imagine you have solar panels on your roof. Your electric car is charging. You have extra energy. Can you sell it to neighbors? The energy grid gets SUPER complicated when you add millions of small producers. Quantum could manage this complexity!

**Quantum Could Help With:**
- Grid optimization (balancing energy supply and demand)
- Network routing (finding best paths for data/energy)
- Renewable energy integration (managing solar and wind)
- GHG/energy consumption reduction (fighting climate change)
- Customer segmentation (knowing what customers want)

## What Makes a GOOD Quantum Use Case?

Companies aren't just picking random problems. They're looking for specific characteristics:
1. **Core Business Problem:** Will solving this REALLY help the company?
2. **Existing Alternative:** Is there a classical computer solution (even if it's not great)?
3. **Proven Quantum Algorithms:** Do we already know quantum can work on this type of problem?
4. **Market Impact:** Will this create competitive advantage? Make money? Save time?
5. **Near-Term Feasibility:** Can we actually DO this with today's quantum computers?

**Example: Airline Gate Scheduling**
- Core Problem: YES - airports waste tons of money on inefficient scheduling
- Existing Alternative: YES - they use classical computers now (but not perfectly)
- Proven Algorithms: YES - quantum algorithms work on scheduling problems
- Market Impact: YES - even 5% improvement = MILLIONS saved per airline
- Feasibility: YES - this is something near-term quantum can handle
