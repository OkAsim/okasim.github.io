- Understanding quantum market
- Business value assessment

**Domain 5: Domain-Specific Expertise**
- If you work in finance, understand finance PLUS quantum
- If you work in healthcare, understand medicine PLUS quantum
- Each industry needs domain experts who also know quantum

**How to Develop Your Talent:**

**Option 1: IBM Quantum Network**
- Access to advanced training programs
- Direct contact with IBM Quantum experts
- Live talks and webinars
- Individualized coaching

**Option 2: Self-Training**
- Take courses like this one

- Read research papers
- Join Qiskit Slack community

**Option 3: Conferences and Events**
- IBM Quantum Developer Conference (annual)
- IBM Quantum Partner Forum
- Local quantum meetups

### 2. Use Case Selection

**Why This Matters:** Not every problem is good for quantum computers. Choosing the RIGHT use case is CRITICAL for success.

**What Makes a GOOD Quantum Use Case?**

**Green Light (Go Ahead!):**
- Uses available routines in Qiskit library
- Problem can be scaled down to manageable size
- Scalability improves the result
- Solution would be disruptive or create competitive advantage
- Can be explored with near-term quantum-classical hybrid approach
- Exists as a classical alternative (fallback plan)

**Yellow Light (Be Careful!):**
- Based on untested research ideas
- Requires careful variable selection
- Problem isn't expected to grow in complexity
- Related to a mission-critical part of business (too risky!)
- Requires quantum fault tolerance (not ready yet)

**Red Light (Don't Try!):**
- Requires inventing a brand new quantum algorithm
- Requires huge volumes of data
- Requires specific performance level to work
- Doesn't address core business problem
- No classical backup solution
- Too experimental or high-risk

**The Three-Part Test for Any Use Case:**

**Question 1:** Does it solve a REAL business problem?
- Example YES: "We want to optimize delivery routes, saving millions annually"
- Example NO: "This is interesting quantum research but doesn't help our business"

**Question 2:** Does a classical solution exist (as a backup)?
- Example YES: "We currently use classical computers for this, but quantum could be better"
- Example NO: "This is completely new territory"

**Question 3:** Can quantum ACTUALLY help?
- Example YES: "Quantum algorithms are proven to help with optimization"
- Example NO: "This problem doesn't fit any quantum use case"

**BONUS:** Check Quantum Potential
- Ask: "When quantum computers scale up, will this problem become MORE valuable to solve?"
- If YES = Good long-term use case
- If NO = Don't invest

### 3. Quantum Safety and Security

**The Quantum Threat:**
Here's a scary scenario: Bad actors today are using "harvest now, decrypt later."

**How it works:**
1. Hacker steals your encrypted data TODAY
2. Stores it in a vault for years
3. In 10-20 years when quantum computers exist, decrypts it
4. Uses your old secrets to hurt you

**Why This Matters:**
- Data needs to stay secret for 30+ years sometimes (government secrets, medical records, business plans)
- Today's encryption won't stop quantum computers
- Criminals are stealing encrypted data NOW

**The Solution: Quantum-Safe Cryptography**
- IBM and other companies developed NEW encryption methods that RESIST quantum computer attacks
- Key Achievement: IBM researchers developed 3 of 4 quantum-resistant methods that NIST (US government) approved for official use by 2024

**What IBM Does:**
- Developed quantum-safe encryption
- Implemented it in IBM infrastructure (z16 mainframe, IBM Cloud)
- Offers IBM Quantum Safe services to help companies transition
- Works with academic and industry partners

**What You Should Do:**
- Start transitioning to quantum-safe encryption NOW
- Don't wait until quantum computers are super powerful
- Use IBM Quantum Safe resources

## Responsible Quantum Computing

**What Does This Mean?** It means developing quantum computing with AWARENESS of its power and potential IMPACTS.

**The Five Principles of Responsible Quantum Computing:**

1. **Make Positive Societal Impact**
   - Use quantum to help humanity
   - Example: Discover medicines, not weapons
   - Example: Clean energy, not pollution

2. **Explore Use Cases with Foresight**
   - Think about consequences BEFORE implementing
   - What could go wrong?
   - How could this be misused?

3. **Promote Products Accurately**
   - Don't oversell quantum capabilities
   - Be honest about current limitations
   - Don't claim quantum solves problems it doesn't

4. **Make Consistent and Transparent Decisions**
   - Be consistent in ethical standards
   - Be transparent about what you're doing
   - Don't hide your quantum projects

5. **Build Diverse and Inclusive Community**
   - Include people from different backgrounds
   - Different perspectives = better solutions
   - Make quantum accessible to everyone

**IBM's Enforcement:**
- Contract language requiring responsible use
- Clients must sign "acceptable use clauses"
- Clients CANNOT use quantum computers for illegal or harmful purposes
- IBM monitors and enforces these rules

**Your Role:** As you explore quantum computing, YOU decide which use cases to pursue. Choose responsibly!
