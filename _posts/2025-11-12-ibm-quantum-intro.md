## Cornell Notes

**What is quantum computing?**
- A quantum computer is a super-powerful computer that uses the rules of quantum mechanics (really tiny physics) to solve really complicated math problems
- Regular computers use bits (1s and 0s), but quantum computers use qubits that can be both 1 AND 0 at the same time
- This makes them way faster for certain problems!

**Will quantum computers replace regular computers?**
- Quantum computers WON'T replace regular computers
- Instead, they'll work TOGETHER!
- Your laptop is great for regular tasks, but quantum computers handle the super-hard math problems
- It's like having a regular hammer AND a power drill - different tools for different jobs!

**What problems can quantum computers solve?**
Three main things:
- **Simulation:** Copy how atoms and chemicals behave (like predicting new medicines)
- **Optimization:** Find the best answer to super-complicated puzzles (like planning the best delivery route for 1,000 packages)
- **Complex Data:** Work with messy, complicated information to find patterns

**What is a qubit?**
- A qubit (quantum bit) is like a super bit that can be 0, 1, or BOTH at the same time
- This is called "superposition" and it's what makes quantum computers so powerful!

**Why does business care about quantum?**
Companies want quantum computers to:
- Discover new medicines faster
- Create new materials
- Improve supply chains
- Make better business decisions
- Solve problems that regular computers can't handle in a reasonable time

**When did IBM launch quantum in the cloud?**
- 2016 - IBM was the first company to let regular people use quantum computers over the internet through the IBM Quantum Experience

**Who started quantum computing?**
- Multiple scientists, but Richard Feynman (in 1981) was the first to say "Hey, quantum computers could work!"
- Charles Bennett (1970) first wrote about quantum information theory

## Big Timeline of Quantum Computing

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1970 | IBM scientist Charles Bennett writes "quantum information theory" - the very first idea! |
| 1981 | Richard Feynman gives a famous speech saying quantum computers are a wonderful idea |
| 2016 | IBM launches cloud quantum computers - now ANYONE can use them online! |
| 2017 | IBM releases Qiskit - a FREE tool so people can write programs for quantum computers |
| 2020 | IBM releases a roadmap to build HUGE quantum computers with millions of qubits in the future |
| 2022 | IBM creates the Osprey processor with 433 qubits - their biggest yet! |
| 2023-2024 | IBM launches the Heron processor with 156 qubits - even more powerful and better than before |

## Key Terms

**Qubits:** The basic unit of quantum information. Unlike regular bits, qubits can exist in multiple states at once, allowing quantum computers to process massive amounts of information faster.

**Quantum Mechanics:** The science of how really, REALLY tiny things (like atoms and electrons) behave. It's different from regular physics and is the superpower behind quantum computers!

**Simulation:** Using quantum computers to copy and predict how atoms, chemicals, and materials will behave in real life.

**Optimization:** Using quantum computers to find the BEST solution to complicated problems with lots of choices.

## Vocabulary Builder

| Term | Easy Definition | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Quantum | Really, really tiny - like atoms and electrons | A single electron is quantum-sized |
| Qubit | A quantum bit; can be 0, 1, or both at once | The basic building block of a quantum computer |
| Superposition | Being in multiple states at the same time | A coin spinning in the air is both heads AND tails until it lands |
| Simulation | Copying how something works in real life | Using a video game to practice flying a plane |
| Optimization | Finding the best possible answer | Finding the fastest route home from school |
| Cloud Computing | Using computers over the internet | Using Google Drive instead of storing files on your computer |
| Classical Computer | Regular computers (laptops, phones, tablets) | Your iPhone or laptop |
| Hybrid | Two different things working together | A car that uses both gas and electricity |

## Summary

Quantum computers are a NEW kind of super-computer that uses quantum mechanics to solve impossible-for-regular-computers problems. They're not here to replace your laptop - they'll work WITH regular computers to tackle huge challenges.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Quantum computers use qubits instead of regular bits
- They can solve three types of problems: Simulation, Optimization, and Complex Data
- They work WITH classical computers, not instead of them
- Companies are preparing NOW for the quantum future
- The technology started in the 1970s but only recently became available to regular people

**Cool Facts:**
- Richard Feynman predicted quantum computers would be amazing way back in 1981
- You can use IBM's quantum computers RIGHT NOW through the internet
- The newest quantum chips have over 150 qubits and are getting better every year
- Quantum computers could help discover new medicines, create new materials, and solve supply chain problems

**Think About It:**
Why would a company spend money on quantum computers if regular supercomputers already exist? Answer: Because there are some problems that regular computers could take THOUSANDS OF YEARS to solve, but quantum computers might solve in HOURS or DAYS!
