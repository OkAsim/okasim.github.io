## Cornell Notes

**What is energy?**
- A measure of an object's ability to change its own motion or another object's motion
- Comes in different forms: kinetic (movement), potential (stored), etc.
- Energy can change forms but the total amount stays the same (conservation of energy)

**What is kinetic energy?**
- Energy of motion
- Formula: KE = ½ × mass × velocity²
- A big dog has more kinetic energy than a small dog moving at the same speed
- A fast dog has more kinetic energy than a slow dog of the same size

**What is potential energy?**
- Stored energy that could be converted to motion
- Examples: a ball held up high, a compressed spring, food energy
- Can be thought of as "energy of position"

**What is a barrier?**
- Something that blocks objects from passing through
- Examples: fences, walls, mountains
- In energy terms: a place where potential energy is very high
- Classical objects need enough energy to go over the barrier

**What is quantum tunneling?**
- When a particle passes THROUGH a barrier it doesn't have enough energy to cross
- Like a dog passing through a fence without digging or jumping
- Totally impossible in classical physics!
- Possible in quantum physics because of uncertainty

**How does tunneling work?**
- Due to the uncertainty principle and wavefunctions
- Wavefunctions extend into "forbidden" regions
- There's a small probability of finding particles on the other side of barriers
- The thicker the barrier, the less likely tunneling becomes

**What affects tunneling probability?**
- Thickness of barrier (thicker = less likely)
- Height of barrier (higher = less likely)
- Mass of the object (heavier = less likely)
- That's why we don't see dogs tunneling through fences!

**What is a scanning tunneling microscope?**
- Powerful tool that uses quantum tunneling to "see" individual atoms
- Has a super sharp metal tip that gets very close to a surface
- Electrons tunnel between the tip and surface
- Amount of tunneling depends on distance
- Scientists can map the surface atom by atom

**What are practical applications?**
- Scanning tunneling microscopes let scientists see and move individual atoms
- Tunnel diodes and other electronic components
- Nuclear fusion in the Sun happens because of tunneling
- Without tunneling, stars wouldn't shine!

## Summary

Quantum tunneling is when particles pass through barriers they shouldn't have enough energy to cross like walking through a wall! This happens because of the wave nature of matter and the uncertainty principle. A particle's wavefunction extends slightly into and sometimes through barriers, giving a small chance of finding the particle on the other side. While dogs and people are too large to tunnel through fences, electrons do it all the time. Scientists use this in scanning tunneling microscopes to see individual atoms. Tunneling even powers the Sun protons in the Sun's core tunnel through the barriers that normally keep them apart, allowing nuclear fusion to happen!
