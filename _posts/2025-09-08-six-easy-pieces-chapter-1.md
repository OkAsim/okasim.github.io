## Cornell Notes

**What is the atomic hypothesis?**
- All things are made of atoms
- Atoms are small particles in constant motion
- Atoms attract each other at small distances
- Atoms repel when squeezed together
- This simple idea explains much of our world

**How small are atoms?**
- About 1-2 × 10⁻⁸ cm in radius (1-2 angstroms)
- If a water drop were magnified to the size of the Earth, atoms would be about the size of apples
- Too small to see with regular microscopes
- About a million times smaller than the smallest thing visible to the eye

**What happens to atoms in different states of matter?**
- **Solid (like ice):**
  - Atoms vibrate but stay in fixed positions
  - Arranged in a crystal pattern
  - Rigid structure resists change
- **Liquid (like water):**
  - Atoms can roll over each other
  - Still close together but not fixed
  - Can flow and take shape of container
- **Gas (like steam):**
  - Atoms move freely away from each other
  - Large spaces between atoms
  - Fills entire container

**What happens when water evaporates?**
- Water molecules at the surface sometimes get extra energy from collisions
- These molecules can break away from liquid and enter air as vapor
- Water molecules also return from air to liquid
- When more leave than return, the water evaporates
- The process cools the remaining water (fastest molecules leave)

**How do things dissolve in water?**
- Using salt as an example:
  - Water molecules attract the charged parts of salt (ions)
  - Electrical forces pull ions away from the salt crystal
  - Ions float freely in water, surrounded by water molecules
  - Process is dynamic - ions leave and rejoin the crystal

**What are chemical reactions?**
- Atoms change partners to form new molecules
- Example: Carbon burning in oxygen
  - Oxygen molecules break apart
  - Oxygen atoms combine with carbon atoms
  - New molecules (CO and CO₂) form
  - Energy is released because new bonds are stronger

**What evidence do we have for atoms?**
- **Brownian motion:** Small particles in water jiggle around randomly due to collisions with water molecules
- **Crystal structures:** X-ray analysis shows regular patterns exactly as predicted by atomic theory
- Can't see atoms directly with normal microscopes, but evidence is overwhelming

## Summary

Chapter 1 introduces the fundamental idea that everything is made of atoms - tiny particles in constant motion that attract each other at short distances but repel when pushed too close together. This simple concept explains the different states of matter (solid, liquid, gas), physical processes like evaporation and dissolution, and even chemical reactions. Though atoms are too small to see directly, their effects are observable everywhere. Understanding atoms provides a foundation for comprehending virtually all physical phenomena, from everyday observations like melting ice to complex processes like chemical reactions.
