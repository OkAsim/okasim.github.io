## Cornell Notes

**What is quantum teleportation?**
- A way to transfer the quantum state of one particle to another distant particle
- NOT like Star Trek teleportation objects don't physically move
- Only the information about the quantum state is transferred
- Like sending instructions for building something, not the thing itself

**How is it different from regular teleportation?**
- No objects disappear and reappear
- Only transfers quantum states, not physical matter
- Need to have particles at both locations already
- Like sending a recipe, not the actual food

**What is classical teleportation?**
- Similar to using a fax machine
- Scan an object, send information, recreate it elsewhere
- This works fine for regular information

**Why can't we just measure and copy?**
- The no-cloning theorem prevents perfect copying of unknown quantum states
- When you measure a quantum state, you change it
- Can't measure both aspects of a superposition at once
- No way to get complete information about an unknown quantum state

**What do we need for quantum teleportation?**
1. Entangled pair of particles (shared between sender and receiver)
2. The particle whose state we want to teleport
3. A way to make measurements and send classical information

**What are the steps?**
1. Share an entangled pair with your partner
2. Make a special measurement between your entangled particle and the particle to teleport
3. Send the measurement result to your partner through regular communication
4. Partner adjusts their particle based on your message

**What happens to the original?**
- The original particle loses its special state
- This preserves the no-cloning theorem
- You can't end up with two copies of the same quantum state

**Has this been demonstrated?**
- Yes! First done in 1997 by scientists in Austria
- Initially teleported photons over half a meter
- Later experiments teleported photons across the Danube River (600 meters)
- Now scientists have teleported states of atoms and even groups of atoms

**What are the limitations?**
- Not faster than light still need to send a regular message
- Only works for quantum states, not complete objects
- Need to have matching "receiver" particles at the destination
- Not practical for teleporting large objects or people... yet

**What are possible applications?**
- Quantum computing: connecting quantum computers together
- Quantum internet: transmitting quantum information securely
- Preserving fragile quantum states that are difficult to move physically

## Summary

Quantum teleportation is a method for transferring the exact quantum state of one particle to another distant particle, using entanglement as a resource. Unlike Star Trek teleportation, no physical objects move only the quantum information is transferred. The process requires sharing an entangled pair of particles, making a special measurement, and sending regular information. While we can't teleport dogs or people (yet!), scientists have successfully teleported the states of photons, atoms, and even groups of atoms. Quantum teleportation could be crucial for quantum computing and creating a quantum internet, allowing us to transmit quantum information reliably over long distances.
