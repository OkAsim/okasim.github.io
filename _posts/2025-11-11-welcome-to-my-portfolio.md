## Hey! 👋

So I built a website. At 11.

I know, I know - "Shouldn't you be playing video games?" And yeah, I do (Clash Royale, Zelda, and NBA2k are my current favorites). But I also really like quantum physics and coding, and I needed somewhere to organize all my stuff.

## What's Here

📖 **About** - How I ended up reading Feynman and programming quantum computers

🔧 **Projects** - Stuff I'm building (quantum circuits, Python programs, that hoverboard from summer)

📚 **Research & Notes** - My Cornell notes from physics books (yes, I take notes on summer reading)

✍️ **Blog** - Updates about what I'm learning and working on

## Why?

Three reasons:
1. **Help other students** - If my notes or code help someone, awesome
2. **Organize my thoughts** - Writing helps me actually understand things
3. **Connect with researchers** - Maybe someday I can help with real research

## What I'm Working On

Right now I'm:
- Learning IBM Qiskit (quantum computing)
- Prepping for AP CSP (yeah, in 6th grade)
- Finishing Algebra 1 and starting Algebra 2 in December
- Organizing my physics notes to share

That's it! I'll post updates as I work on stuff. If you want to chat about physics, math, or coding, hit me up!
