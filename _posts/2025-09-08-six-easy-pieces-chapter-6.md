## Cornell Notes

**What is quantum mechanics?**
- Atomic Mechanics & Quantum Mechanics
- Quantum mechanics is the science that describes how tiny things behave, especially at the atomic level
- Classical physics (Newton's laws) works great for everyday things we can see and touch
- But at the atomic scale, things behave completely differently
- Atoms and electrons do NOT behave like anything we've ever seen in daily life
- They're not like balls, waves, clouds, or springs

**Is light a particle or wave?**
- **The Wave-Particle Mystery**
- Historically, scientists couldn't decide if light and electrons were particles or waves:
  - Newton's theory: Light is made of particles
  - Later discovery: Light behaves like a wave
  - 20th century: Light sometimes behaves like a particle again!
  - Electrons: Same confusing story - they act like both
- Modern answer: They are neither purely particles nor purely waves
- Scientists now say "It is like neither" and accept that quantum objects are "particle-waves"

**What happens with bullets and two holes?**
- **The Bullet Experiment (Classical Behavior)**
- Imagine a machine gun shooting at a wall with two holes. Behind the wall is a target with a sand detector:
  - Bullets come through either hole 1 OR hole 2
  - They travel in straight lines after passing through
  - Some bullets hit near the center, some hit farther away
- Key finding: The pattern with both holes = pattern from hole 1 + pattern from hole 2
- The probabilities simply ADD together - this is called "no interference" because the two holes don't affect each other

**What happens with water waves and two holes?**
- **The Water Wave Experiment (Wave Behavior)**
- Same setup but now with water waves instead of bullets:
  - Waves pass through BOTH holes at the same time
  - New circular waves spread out from each hole
  - The two waves meet and interact
- Pattern is NOT just hole 1 + hole 2
- **Interference:** When waves meet, they either:
  - Constructive interference: Wave peaks add together → BIG intensity
  - Destructive interference: Wave peaks cancel out → SMALL intensity
- This creates alternating bands of high and low intensity on the detector

**How do electrons behave with two holes?**
- **The Electron Experiment (Quantum Behavior)**
- Now shoot electrons at a wall with two holes:
  - Electrons act like WAVES initially
  - They go through BOTH holes at once
  - They interfere with each other like water waves
  - We see an interference pattern (alternating bright and dark bands)
  - Pattern is NOT just electron 1 + electron 2
- **BUT HERE'S THE WEIRD PART:**
  - When we try to WATCH which hole each electron goes through, the pattern changes!
  - If we detect which hole an electron uses, it suddenly acts like a particle and the interference disappears
  - This is one of the greatest mysteries of quantum mechanics

**What is the uncertainty principle?**
- **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**
- One of the most important ideas in quantum mechanics:
  - You CANNOT know both the exact position AND exact speed of a tiny particle at the same time
  - If you measure WHERE an electron is, you can't know HOW FAST it's going
  - If you measure HOW FAST it's going, you can't know WHERE it is
  - There's a limit to how precise your measurements can be simultaneously
- Why? The act of observing a tiny particle always disturbs it
- You can't measure something without changing it at the quantum level

## Important Vocabulary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Quantum mechanics | The rules that describe how atoms and tiny particles behave |
| Interference | When two waves overlap and either strengthen or weaken each other |
| Wave-particle duality | The strange fact that electrons and photons act like both waves and particles |
| Constructive interference | Waves adding together to make a bigger wave |
| Destructive interference | Waves canceling each other out to make a smaller wave |
| Observer effect | When measuring something changes its behavior (especially at quantum scale) |
| Uncertainty principle | You can't know both position and velocity of a particle precisely at the same time |

## Summary: The Double-Slit Experiment

**Main Idea:** Atoms and electrons behave in ways that seem impossible based on what we know about everyday objects. They don't follow the simple rules of classical physics.

**Key Experiments:**

| Experiment | Pattern | Behavior |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Bullets | Patterns add together (P₁₂ = P₁ + P₂) | Pass through one hole OR the other |
| Water Waves | Complex interference pattern | Pass through both holes and interact |
| Electrons | Interference pattern when not observed; simple pattern when observed | Change behavior when watched! |

**The Big Mystery:** When we're not looking, electrons act like waves passing through both holes. When we watch to see which hole they go through, they act like particles going through just one hole. Just the act of watching changes their behavior!

**Why This Matters:** Understanding quantum behavior helps us build computers, lasers, phones, and everything that uses electricity. It's also one of science's greatest unsolved mysteries - even Einstein had trouble accepting it!
