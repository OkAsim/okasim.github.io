**Book:** Six Easy Pieces by Richard Feynman

**Chapter:** Preface

---

## Cornell Notes

**Why did Feynman create these lectures?**
- For freshman and sophomore students at Caltech
- To maintain the interest of smart students coming from high school
- To provide exciting modern physics ideas instead of just the basics
- To save students from getting bored with traditional physics teaching

**Who was his audience?**
- College freshmen and sophomores at Caltech
- Very smart and enthusiastic students
- Students who had heard physics was exciting but weren't seeing that in class
- Both advanced students and those who struggled

**What was Feynman's teaching approach?**
- Made lectures challenging even for the smartest students
- Tried to be very accurate in all statements
- Showed how ideas fit into the bigger picture of physics
- Clearly marked what was new vs. what could be figured out
- Didn't follow strict order - mentioned topics before fully explaining them

**What problems did Feynman face?**
- No feedback from students during lectures
- Hard to know if students understood the material
- Couldn't tell how effective the lectures were
- Second year (electricity and magnetism) was harder to make interesting
- Not enough time to fully cover quantum mechanics

**What parts of the course aren't in the book?**
- Recitation sections where students worked in small groups
- Laboratory sessions each week
- Lectures on problem-solving techniques
- A lecture on inertial guidance that was missed

**How did Feynman feel about the results?**
- Somewhat disappointed with how most students did on exams
- Happy that some students (about 24) understood almost everything
- Believed the best teaching happens one-on-one with students
- Hoped the lectures would inspire teachers and students elsewhere
- Wished there had been more problem practice

## Summary

In his preface, Feynman explains that he created these lectures to make physics more exciting for smart college students who were getting bored with traditional teaching. He tried to challenge even the brightest students while still providing a core that everyone could grasp. Although he wasn't completely satisfied with the results (only some students really understood everything), he hoped the lectures would provide inspiration for teachers and students elsewhere. The book doesn't include everything from the original course, like lab sessions and problem-solving sections, but captures the main lecture content.
