## Cornell Notes

**What is the law of gravitation?**
- Every object in the universe attracts every other object
- Force is proportional to both masses
- Force varies inversely as square of distance
- Formula: F = G(mm')/r²
- One of the most far-reaching generalizations in science
- Nature follows this with "completeness and generality"

**What are Kepler's three laws of planetary motion?**
- **First Law:** Each planet moves in an ellipse with the sun at one focus
- **Second Law:** The radius vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times (planets move faster when closer to sun)
- **Third Law:** Squares of periods are proportional to cubes of orbit sizes (T² ∝ a³)

**How did dynamics develop?**
- Tycho Brahe made accurate measurements of planetary positions
- Kepler discovered patterns in the data (his three laws)
- Galileo discovered principle of inertia
- Newton combined insights: planets need force toward sun, not tangent to orbit
- Force of gravity provides continuous inward pull

**How did Newton connect Earth and Moon?**
- Objects on Earth fall 16 feet in first second
- Moon is 60 times farther from Earth's center than surface
- By inverse square law, Moon should fall 1/3600 as far
- 16 ft ÷ 3600 ≈ 1/20 inch per second
- This matches Moon's observed "fall" toward Earth!
- Same gravity governs both Earth and celestial motions

**Why doesn't the Moon fall to Earth?**
- Moon IS falling toward Earth constantly
- But Moon also moving sideways very fast
- Earth's surface curves away as Moon falls
- Moon falls "around" the Earth in circular path
- Balance between inward fall and sideways motion
- Like a ball on a string being swung in circle

**How fast must something move to orbit Earth?**
- Must go about 5 miles per second at Earth's surface
- At this speed, Earth curves away as fast as object falls
- Object falls 16 feet but stays same height above surface
- This is how satellites and astronauts orbit
- Gagarin orbited at ~5 miles/second

**What causes tides?**
- Moon pulls on Earth and its water
- Water closer to Moon is pulled more than average
- Water farther from Moon is pulled less than average
- Creates two bulges of water (near side and far side)
- As Earth rotates, these bulges cause high/low tides
- Earth and Moon both orbit common center of mass

**What evidence supports universal gravitation?**
- Moon's orbit matches predictions
- Tides explained by lunar gravity
- Jupiter's moons follow same laws
- Discovery of Neptune by calculating gravitational effects
- Double stars orbit each other predictably
- Globular clusters held together by gravity
- Galaxy shapes due to gravitational attraction

**What was the discovery of Neptune?**
- Uranus orbit didn't match predictions exactly
- Adams and Le Verrier independently calculated:
  - Another planet must be causing perturbations
  - Predicted where unknown planet should be
- Astronomers pointed telescopes to predicted location
- Found Neptune exactly where predicted!
- Spectacular confirmation of Newton's law

**What is Cavendish's experiment?**
- First direct measurement of gravitational force between objects
- Used lead balls on torsion balance (1798)
- Measured tiny twist from gravitational attraction
- Determined gravitational constant G
- Called "weighing the Earth" because it allowed calculation of Earth's mass
- G = 6.670 × 10⁻¹¹ newton·m²/kg²

**What is gravity? What causes it?**
- Newton described WHAT gravity does, not HOW it works
- No mechanism or "machinery" has been found
- Physical laws are often mathematical descriptions, not mechanical explanations
- Many attempts to explain gravity have failed
- Example: particle bombardment theory predicts wrong effects
- May be that mathematical description is the deepest understanding possible

**How does gravity compare to electricity?**
- Both follow inverse square law
- Both depend on properties of two objects
- But gravity is ENORMOUSLY weaker
- Electrical force between two electrons is 4.17 × 10⁴² times stronger than gravitational
- This huge number must involve "something deep in nature"
- Possibly connected to age of universe?

**How did Einstein modify Newton's theory?**
- Gravity is not instantaneous - limited by speed of light
- Objects with energy (like light) have gravitational mass
- Light bends when passing near sun (observed during eclipses)
- Gravity described as curvature of space-time
- Mercury's orbit shows effects not explained by Newton
- Einstein's theory = general relativity

## Summary

Chapter 5 explores the theory of gravitation, one of the most elegant and powerful principles in physics. Newton discovered that every object attracts every other object with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of distance between them. This single law explains planetary motion (confirming Kepler's laws), tides, satellite orbits, the structure of galaxies, and allowed the discovery of Neptune through pure calculation. Cavendish's experiment directly measured gravitational attraction and determined Earth's mass. Despite gravity's success in prediction, its mechanism remains mysterious - no one knows "how" it works, only "what" it does mathematically. Einstein later modified Newton's theory through general relativity, describing gravity as the curvature of space-time itself rather than a force, explaining previously unexplained phenomena like the bending of light near massive objects.
