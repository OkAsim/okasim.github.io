## Cornell Notes

**What is an interpretation of quantum mechanics?**
- A way to explain what the math means in real life
- Connects equations to what we observe in experiments
- Needed because quantum math doesn't directly match our everyday experience

**What are the Four Central Principles?**
1. **Wavefunctions:** Every object has a mathematical wavefunction
2. **Allowed states:** Quantum objects can only be found in certain states
3. **Probability:** The wavefunction tells us the probability of each allowed state
4. **Measurement:** Measuring forces the object into one definite state

**What is a superposition?**
- When an object exists in multiple states at the same time
- Like a dog treat being in both the left and right boxes at once
- Only exists until someone measures or observes the object

**What is polarization?**
- The direction that light waves oscillate
- Can be vertical, horizontal, or at any angle
- Good example of a quantum system with two allowed states

**What is a quantum eraser?**
- An experiment showing how measurement affects quantum systems
- Light passes through two slits, making an interference pattern
- If we measure which slit the light went through, pattern disappears
- If we "erase" that measurement, pattern comes back!

**What is the Copenhagen interpretation?**
- First major interpretation of quantum mechanics
- Developed by Niels Bohr and colleagues in Denmark
- Says quantum objects exist in superpositions until measured
- When measured, the wavefunction "collapses" to one state

**What is wavefunction collapse?**
- When a quantum object in multiple states becomes just one state
- Happens when someone measures or observes the object
- Like a dog treat actually appearing in only one box when you look

**What is Schrödinger's cat?**
- Famous thought experiment about quantum weirdness
- A cat in a box could be alive or dead depending on a quantum event
- According to quantum theory, cat would be both alive AND dead until box is opened
- Schrödinger created this example to show how absurd quantum theory seemed

**What are problems with Copenhagen?**
- Doesn't explain why large objects don't show quantum behavior
- Unclear what counts as a "measurement"
- No equation for wavefunction collapse
- Seems to make reality depend on observation

## Summary

The Copenhagen interpretation tries to explain what quantum physics means in real life. It says that quantum objects exist in multiple states at once (superposition) until they are measured, which forces them to pick just one state (wavefunction collapse). This interpretation follows four key principles: everything has a wavefunction, objects can only be found in certain allowed states, the wavefunction gives probabilities, and measurement determines the outcome. While this interpretation works for calculations, it raises philosophical questions about reality like with Schrödinger's cat, which would supposedly be both alive and dead until someone looked in the box.
