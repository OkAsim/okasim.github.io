## Cornell Notes

**What is entanglement?**
- A quantum connection between two or more particles
- The particles' states are linked together
- Measuring one particle instantly determines the state of the other
- Works even when particles are far apart!

**What's a simple example?**
- Two dogs that always do the same thing
- If one dog is asleep, the other is always asleep
- If one dog is awake, the other is always awake
- Checking one dog tells you about the other dog instantly

**Who was against this idea?**
- Albert Einstein didn't like quantum entanglement
- Called it "spooky action at a distance"
- Thought it violated the rules of space and time
- Argued with Niels Bohr about it for years

**What was the EPR paradox?**
- Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen created this argument in 1935
- Used entanglement to argue quantum theory was incomplete
- Said particles must have definite properties all along
- Claimed there must be "hidden variables" we can't measure

**What is a Local Hidden Variable theory?**
- Type of theory Einstein preferred
- "Local" means effects can't travel faster than light
- "Hidden variables" means particles have definite properties
- Like saying the dog was definitely asleep all along, we just didn't know

**What is nonlocality?**
- Property of quantum mechanics
- Allows instant effects between distant particles
- Means measurement in one place affects particles elsewhere
- Seems to violate our understanding of space

**Who was John Bell?**
- Physicist who found a way to test Einstein vs. Bohr
- Proved that LHV theories have mathematical limits
- Showed quantum mechanics predicts results beyond these limits
- Created "Bell's theorem" in 1964

**What is Bell's theorem?**
- Mathematical proof that no LHV theory can match quantum predictions
- Shows that reality has to be either non-local (faster-than-light connections exist) OR indeterminate (properties don't exist until measured)
- Either way, Einstein was wrong!

**How was Bell's theorem tested?**
- Alain Aspect did experiments in 1981-1982
- Used entangled photons with polarization measurements
- Results matched quantum predictions, not LHV limits
- Proved our universe doesn't follow LHV theories
- Confirmed that quantum mechanics is correct!

**Can entanglement send messages?**
- No, cannot be used for faster-than-light communication
- Measurement outcomes are random
- But it can be used for quantum cryptography and computing

## Summary

Quantum entanglement creates a spooky connection between particles that even Einstein couldn't accept. When two particles are entangled, measuring one instantly determines the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are! Einstein thought this violated the rules of space and time, suggesting particles must have "hidden variables" all along. But John Bell proved mathematically that no local hidden variable theory could match what quantum mechanics predicts. Experiments by Alain Aspect confirmed Bell's theorem, showing our universe really does have this bizarre nonlocal property. While entanglement can't send faster-than-light messages, it's crucial for quantum cryptography and computing.
