## What I'm Building

This is where I document the stuff I'm actually making, not just reading about. Some of it works great, some of it... needs more debugging. That's part of the fun!

## Quantum Computing

### Learning IBM Qiskit
**Status:** Very Much In Progress | **Started:** October 2025

So I'm learning to program quantum computers. Which is kind of insane when you think about it, because these are computers that use particles being in multiple states at once to solve problems.

**What I'm doing:**
- Taking IBM's Quantum Business Foundations course (sounds fancy, but it's actually really fun)
- Learning about quantum gates (not the kind you put on fences)
- Writing quantum circuits in Python using Qiskit
- Running simulations and trying to figure out why my qubit isn't doing what I want it to

**Cool things I'm learning:**
- Superposition (particles being in multiple states at once, seriously!)
- Entanglement (particles that are mysteriously connected even when far apart)
- Quantum gates that manipulate qubits
- Why quantum computers might be really good at certain problems

**The confusing parts:**
Honestly? Most of it is confusing at first. You can't just think about bits being 0 or 1 anymore. Now they're 0 AND 1 at the same time until you measure them. My brain is still adjusting.

**What's next:**
I want to build some actual quantum circuits that do interesting things, not just tutorial examples. Maybe a quantum random number generator, or trying some simple quantum algorithms. I'll post them here when they actually work!

**Resources:** [IBM Quantum Learning](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning) (it's free!)

## Physics Experiments

### The Hoverboard Project
**Status:** Built it! | **Summer 2025 at ATDP UC Berkeley**

For my physics class final project, our whole class worked together to build a hoverboard. A real one. Well, real in the sense that it actually levitates using a blower, not real in the sense of Back to the Future (sorry to disappoint).

**What I learned:**
- How air pressure levitation actually works
- Why getting the right balance is WAY harder than it looks
- That when the calculations are wrong, the hoverboard just falls over
- How satisfying it is when physics equations turn into actual floating objects

**The best part:** Watching it actually work after so many failed attempts. There's something amazing about seeing math turn into something physical that defies gravity.

**The worst part:** The times it didn't work and we had to figure out where our calculations went wrong. (Spoiler alert: the math was usually fine, we just needed to adjust the airflow.)

I have some videos of it working! I'll upload them soon once I figure out the best way to share them here.

**Why this matters:** This project made me realize I don't just want to be a theoretical physicist. I want to BUILD things and test whether the physics actually works in real life.

## Python Programming

### My Coding Journey (Age 6 to Now)

I started coding in Python when I was 6, right after I learned to read. My parents set me up with some beginner tutorials, probably thinking I'd get bored after a week. Plot twist: I didn't.

**What I've been learning:**
- Followed Python tutorials and made small games (lots of broken ones before I got things working!)
- Math problem solvers and simple calculators
- Basic physics simulations (making balls bounce with actual physics equations)
- Learning about data structures and algorithms
- Exploring whatever seems interesting that week

**Current focus:**
Right now I'm preparing for the **AP Computer Science Principles exam** in May 2026. Yes, I know I'm in 6th grade. The material is really interesting. It's not just about coding, it's about how computers think and how computing affects society.

**My favorite thing about programming:**
When you spend an hour debugging something and finally find that ONE missing parenthesis, and suddenly everything works. That feeling never gets old.

**What I want to build:**
- Physics simulations for concepts from my quantum physics reading
- Programs to help visualize quantum gates and circuits
- Tools to make my Cornell notes more interactive
- Whatever else seems cool

*Most of my early projects were just tutorials and learning exercises. As I work on more original stuff, I'll share it here!*

## What's Coming Next

**Short-term (next few months):**
1. Actually working quantum circuits in Qiskit (not just tutorials)
2. Python projects related to AP CSP concepts
3. Maybe some physics simulations

**Long-term (when I learn more):**
1. Contributing to open-source physics or quantum computing education projects
2. Building more complex quantum algorithms
3. Projects that combine everything - physics, engineering, and code

## Want to Collaborate?

If you're:
- Another student who wants to learn this stuff together
- A teacher who needs help testing educational materials
- Someone with a cool project idea
- Just curious about what an 11-year-old trying to learn quantum computing is up to

Feel free to reach out! I'm always down to talk about projects or learn new things.
