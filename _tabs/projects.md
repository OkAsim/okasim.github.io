## What I'm Building

This is where I put stuff I'm actually making, not just reading about. Some of it works great, some of it... needs more debugging.

## Quantum Computing

### Learning IBM Qiskit
**Status:** In Progress | **Started:** October 2025

I'm learning to program quantum computers. These are computers that use particles being in multiple states at once to solve problems.

I'm taking IBM's Quantum Business Foundations course. Learning about quantum gates (not the kind you put on fences), writing quantum circuits in Python using Qiskit, and running simulations trying to figure out why my qubit isn't doing what I want it to.

The superposition and entanglement stuff is interesting. Particles being in multiple states at once, particles mysteriously connected even when far apart. Most of it is confusing at first. You can't just think about bits being 0 or 1 anymore. Now they're 0 AND 1 at the same time until you measure them. My brain is still adjusting.

I want to build some actual quantum circuits that do interesting things, not just tutorial examples. Maybe a quantum random number generator, or trying some simple quantum algorithms. I'll post them here when they work.

## Physics Experiments

### [The Hoverboard Project](/about/#summer-2025-physics-camp---uc-berkeley-atdp)
**Status:** Built | **Summer 2025 at ATDP UC Berkeley**

For my physics class final project, our whole class worked together to build a hoverboard. A real one. Well, real in the sense that it actually levitates using a blower, not real in the sense of Back to the Future (sorry to disappoint).

Getting the right balance was way harder than it looks. When the calculations are wrong, the hoverboard just falls over. Watching it work after so many failed attempts was satisfying. Seeing math turn into something physical that defies gravity.

I have some videos of it working. I'll upload them soon once I figure out the best way to share them here.

## Python Programming

### My Coding Journey (Age 6 to Now)

I started coding in Python when I was 6, right after I learned to read. My parents set me up with some beginner tutorials, probably thinking I'd get bored after a week. Plot twist: I didn't.

I've been following Python tutorials and making small games (lots of broken ones before I got things working), math problem solvers and simple calculators, basic physics simulations (making balls bounce with actual physics equations), learning about data structures and algorithms, and exploring whatever seems interesting that week.

Right now I'm preparing for the **AP Computer Science Principles exam** in May 2026. Since I've been coding since I was 6, the material isn't too hard.

When you spend an hour debugging something and finally find that one missing parenthesis, and suddenly everything works. That feeling never gets old.

I want to build physics simulations for concepts from my quantum physics reading, programs to help visualize quantum gates and circuits, tools to make my Cornell notes more interactive, and whatever else seems interesting.

*Most of my early projects were just tutorials and learning exercises. As I work on more original stuff, I'll share it here.*

## What's Coming Next

**Short-term (next few months):**
1. Actually working quantum circuits in Qiskit (not just tutorials)
2. Python projects related to AP CSP concepts
3. Maybe some physics simulations

**Long-term (when I learn more):**
1. Help with open-source projects about physics or quantum computing
2. Building more complex quantum algorithms
3. Projects that combine everything - physics, engineering, and code

## Get In Touch

**For researchers/professors:** I know 11-year-olds don't usually work in labs, but if you think I could help with anything (even just data analysis or testing educational materials), I'd love to hear from you!

**For students:** If you're into physics and math (or just want to learn), definitely reach out. Always happy to share notes or work on stuff together.

**Email:** asimmikahmed [at] gmail
