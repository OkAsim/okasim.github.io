## 👋 Hi! I'm Asim

I'm 11 years old, in 6th grade, and I'm kind of obsessed with quantum physics. Yeah, I know that sounds weird for someone who still needs to be reminded to clean his room, but hear me out. Quantum mechanics is absolutely WILD and I can't stop reading about it.

I also love coding in Python (been doing it since I was 6), working on math problems that make my brain hurt in a good way, and trying to convince my friends that physics is actually cooler than any video game. (I'm still working on that last one.)

## How I Got Here

So in 5th grade, I told my dad I wanted to build things. Not like LEGO (though that's fun too), but like... real stuff. He signed me up for a physics class at ATDP UC Berkeley for the summer.

I tried to prepare by reading some books and watching YouTube videos, which was kind of interesting, but honestly I wasn't sure what I was getting into.

Then in that class, our whole class worked together with the instructor and grad student TAs to build a **hoverboard**. We actually made a board that FLOATED using a blower and physics. When I saw it work, when I saw all those equations and concepts turn into something real that actually levitated, I was hooked.

After that, I went down this massive YouTube rabbit hole watching physics videos. One by [Professor Dr. Pat Burchat from Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCoGZOnCPtg) really stood out. She was explaining all the different engineering physics specialties like renewable energy, materials science, aerospace physics, computational science, and then she got to quantum science.

She said something that really stuck with me: quantum systems aren't just things you read about in textbooks anymore. Engineers are beginning to build computers that operate at the quantum scale. And she mentioned how in the next decade or so, more of this is going to cross over from physics classrooms to actual engineering applications.

That's when it hit me. Quantum computing is where the future is, but we need SO much more research to get there. The technology is just starting to move from theory to reality, and I want to be part of making that happen.

So I started reading more (Feynman's lectures, quantum physics books), learning IBM Qiskit, and really diving into the math I'd need. It's not just about being interested anymore. I'm actually preparing to be part of building that future.

## 📚 My Learning Journey

> **TL;DR:** Math nerd who codes and reads quantum physics books for fun. Taking AP test in 6th grade. Building stuff with magnets and Python.

### Mathematics
**Art of Problem Solving** courses I've been taking:
- ✅ Beast Academy levels 3-5 (those comic books are genius)
- ✅ [Prealgebra 1](https://data.artofproblemsolving.com/course-docs/syllabi/prealgebra1-syllabus.pdf) (completed July 2025)
- ✅ [Prealgebra 2](https://data.artofproblemsolving.com/course-docs/syllabi/prealgebra2-syllabus.pdf) (completed September 2025)
- 🔄 [Algebra 1](https://data.artofproblemsolving.com/course-docs/syllabi/algebra-a-syllabus.pdf) (finishing December 2025)
- 📅 [Algebra 2](https://data.artofproblemsolving.com/course-docs/syllabi/algebra-b-syllabus.pdf) (starting December 2025)

The problems are HARD but that's what makes them fun. When you finally solve something you've been stuck on for an hour? Best feeling ever.

### Quantum Physics & Computing

**Books I've Read:**
- 📖 [**Six Easy Pieces**](https://www.amazon.com/Six-Easy-Pieces-Essentials-Explained/dp/0465025277/) by Richard Feynman (Spoiler: they're not actually that easy)
- 📖 [**How to Teach Quantum Physics to Your Dog**](https://www.amazon.com/How-Teach-Quantum-Physics-Your/dp/1416572295) by Chad Orzel (Yes, this is a real book!)

**Current Learning:**
- 💻 **IBM Qiskit** (started October 2025) for programming quantum computers (well, simulations)
- 🌌 Quantum computing = using glitches in reality as features instead of bugs

---

### Computer Science

**Timeline:**
- 👶 **Age 6:** Started Python (right after learning to read)
- 🎮 **Age 6-11:** 5+ years building projects
- 📝 **Now:** Prepping for AP Computer Science Principles (May 2026)

Yes, I'm taking an AP test in 6th grade. Yes, it's a lot. But honestly? Pretty fun.

### Summer 2025: Physics Camp

![ATDP Welcome](/assets/img/atdp-welcome.jpg)
*At UC Berkeley's ATDP summer program!*

Last summer I took a physics course at **ATDP UC Berkeley**. For the final project, our whole class built a hoverboard together (using a blower and physics, not magic).

*Me trying not to fall off my hoverboard! It actually works!*

That's when I realized I don't just want to READ about physics - I want to BUILD stuff and see if my calculations were right or hilariously wrong.

## 🎯 What I'm Trying to Do

My big goal is to work with actual researchers on quantum physics and quantum computing projects. I know most 11-year-olds can't exactly walk into a lab, but I'm hoping to:

- 📈 Keep learning advanced math and physics (algebra is just the beginning!)
- 🔧 Build actual quantum circuits and see what they can do
- 🤝 Eventually help with real research, even if it's just data analysis at first

**Long-term?** I want to study **Electrical Engineering** and **Quantum Physics** and work on quantum computers. Imagine building computers that work using the same weird rules that make particles teleport and exist in two places at once. How is that NOT the coolest thing ever?

## Other Stuff About Me

**I'm not JUST a physics nerd, I promise!**

**Piano:** Been playing since I was 6 (same time I started coding!). I love how music and math are connected. Patterns, rhythms, it's all numbers underneath.

**Chess:** Also started at 6. Love the strategy and thinking ahead. My brother and I play from time to time, sometimes even at coffee shops.

**Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu:** Started when I was 8. It's basically human chess with your body. You have to think several moves ahead. I've lost way more matches than I've won, but that's how you learn. Sometimes the best lessons come from getting completely destroyed on the mat.

![BJJ Tournament](/assets/img/bjj-tournament-blurred.jpg)
*One of the rare times I actually won! (Don't let this fool you, I lose a LOT)*

**Gaming:** Strategy games (Clash Royale, Zelda) + sports games (NBA2k). I like games where you have to think, not just button-mash.

**Swimming & Skiing:** Been skiing since age 7. It's basically physics plus speed plus trying not to fall on your face.

**Travel:** Visited 10+ countries! Love trying weird foods (some good, some... not so good) and seeing how different the world is.

**Reading:** Huge reader. I-have-too-many-books-on-my-floor kind of reader.

## How I Manage It All

People ask how I fit everything in. School, AoPs math, piano, BJJ, chess, coding, quantum physics reading, and still being a normal 11-year-old. The answer? **Structure and routine.**

I've kept the same sleep schedule since I was a baby. **6:00 AM wake up, 8:15 PM bedtime, 7 days a week.** (Okay, except for family visits and vacations!) That consistency gives me the energy and focus to stay ahead.

Every day is planned:
- School and homework
- AoPs problem sets
- Piano practice
- BJJ training or other activities
- Time for reading and coding
- Actual downtime (yes, I do relax!)

It's not about being superhuman. It's about **time management** and making the most of every hour. When you have a routine and stick to it, you'd be surprised how much you can accomplish.

> So yeah, I'm not just sitting inside reading physics books 24/7. More like 40% of the time. Maybe 50%. Between piano practice, getting choked out in BJJ, and everything else... okay I still spend a lot of time on physics. But not ALL the time! 😄
