## Quantum Physics Reading

### Six Easy Pieces by Richard Feynman

**Status:** Completed

Feynman's lectures provided my first deep dive into how physicists think about the fundamental nature of reality. These six chapters cover:

1. Atoms in Motion
2. Basic Physics
3. The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences
4. Conservation of Energy
5. The Theory of Gravitation
6. Quantum Behavior

**Key Takeaways:**
- The beauty of physical laws and their mathematical expression
- How quantum mechanics challenges our everyday intuitions
- The scientific method and how physicists approach problems
- The interconnection between different areas of physics

*Cornell notes from each chapter coming soon.*

### How to Teach Quantum Physics to Your Dog by Chad Orzel

**Status:** Completed

This book made quantum mechanics accessible and fun by explaining complex concepts through everyday analogies. Topics covered:

- Wave-particle duality
- The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
- Quantum tunneling
- Entanglement and nonlocality
- Many-worlds interpretation

**What I Learned:**
- Quantum mechanics isn't just mathematical abstraction—it has real applications
- The difference between classical and quantum thinking
- How to explain counterintuitive concepts to others
- The experimental foundations of quantum theory

*Cornell notes available soon. These will include the key concepts and my questions/reflections.*

## Mathematics Coursework

### Art of Problem Solving (AoPS)

I've been working through the AoPS curriculum, which emphasizes problem-solving and mathematical reasoning rather than just computation.

**Completed:**
- Beast Academy levels 3-5
- Prealgebra A (completed)
- Prealgebra B (completed)

**In Progress:**
- Algebra A (finishing December 2025)

**What Makes AoPS Different:**
The focus on why mathematics works, not just how to calculate. This approach connects directly to physics, where understanding the underlying principles is essential.

*I'll be adding summaries of key concepts and challenging problems I've worked through.*

## Cornell Notes Method

I use the Cornell note-taking system for all my reading and coursework:

- **Cue Column:** Key questions and concepts
- **Notes Column:** Detailed explanations and examples
- **Summary:** My own synthesis of the material

This method helps me:
1. Actively engage with material while reading
2. Create study guides for review
3. Identify gaps in my understanding
4. Share organized notes with classmates

## AP Computer Science Principles Prep

**Exam Date:** May 2026

I'm preparing for the AP CSP exam by:
- Working through computational thinking concepts
- Building projects that demonstrate programming skills
- Understanding how computing impacts society
- Exploring algorithms and data representation

*Study notes and practice projects will be added here as I progress.*

## Future Content

I'm working on adding:

1. **Downloadable Cornell Notes** (PDF format) for physics readings
2. **Concept Maps** connecting ideas across physics and mathematics
3. **Practice Problems** with solutions and explanations
4. **Reading Recommendations** for students interested in physics
5. **Study Strategies** that have worked for me
